ColorsMyView
============================

Finished code for Android Kotlin Fundamentals codelab(Lesson 2: Layouts(Constraints Layout))

Introduction
------------

The ColorMyViews app is inspired by the Dutch artist, Piet Mondrian. 
He invented a style of painting style called neoplasticism, 
which uses only vertical and horizontal lines and rectangular shapes in black, white, gray, and primary colors.

Things Learned
-------------

Things that I learned from this App:
- Use Layout Editor to build a ConstraintLayout
- Add TextView and add constraints
- Create a chain of TextView views
- Add clickHandlers to the text views
- Add a baseline constraint
